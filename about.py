    ### Project Features:
    - **Data Exploration**: Visualize and analyze datasets with various charts and graphs.
    - **Supervised Models**: Automated implementation of classification and regression algorithms with hyperparameter optimization using genetic and exhaustive search.
    - **Forecasting**: Forecasting capabilities using Prophet and ARIMA, ideal for predicting future trends in sequential data.
    - **Deep Learning**: Coming soon!

        ### Classification
        - **Accuracy:** Proportion of all classifications that were correct. Higher values indicate better performance.
        - **Precision:** Proportion of positive predictions that were correct. Higher values indicate better performance.
        - **Recall:** Proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly identified. Higher values indicate better performance.
        - **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and completeness, combining precision and recall, to obtain a much more objective value. Higher values indicate better performance.
        - **ROC AUC:** Area under the curve of True Positive Rate versus False Positive Rate at various thresholds. Higher values indicate better performance.

        ### Regression
        - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
        - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values. Better predictions get a result close to *0*.
        - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. Better predictions get a result close to *0*.
        - **R-squared (RÂ²):** Proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.Values close to 1, the model explains well the proportion of the variance. (overfitting in some cases).
